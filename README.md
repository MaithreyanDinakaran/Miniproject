## Title of the Project
Food Quality Analysis Using Image Processing

## About
This project is designed to analyze the quality of food products (specifically fruits and biscuits) using image processing and machine learning techniques. It aims to provide real-time quality assessment by detecting cracks in biscuits and categorizing fruits as fresh or spoiled.

Key Features:

    Real-Time Fruit Quality Detection:
        The system uses YOLO (You Only Look Once), a deep learning-based object detection algorithm, to detect and classify fruits in images.
        It analyzes the color, texture, and brightness of the detected fruits to determine whether they are fresh or spoiled.

    Biscuit Crack Detection:
        The system uses image processing techniques such as edge detection to identify cracks in biscuits.
        It applies methods like Canny edge detection to assess the presence of cracks based on the edges found in the image.

    Quality Classification:
        The system classifies the quality of fruits and biscuits into categories such as "Fresh", "Spoiled", and "Cracked".
        For fruits, it checks factors like color, saturation, brightness, and contrast to assess freshness.
        For biscuits, the system detects cracks by analyzing the image’s edges.

    User Interface:
        The application features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Tkinter where users can upload images of fruits and biscuits for analysis.
        It provides the ability to view uploaded images and results of the analysis, including the number of fresh and spoiled fruits or cracked biscuits.

    Data Preprocessing:
        The uploaded images are preprocessed by adjusting brightness and contrast to enhance the quality of detection.
        Techniques like Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and HSV color space conversion are used to extract relevant features for accurate classification.

    Machine Learning and Deep Learning:
        The system integrates machine learning (ML) for quality assessment and classification tasks.
        YOLOv5, a pre-trained model, is used for real-time object detection of fruits.
        The system also employs image feature extraction methods (like color analysis and texture features) to classify fruit quality.

    Future Enhancements:
        Expanding the system to handle a wider variety of fruits and food items.
        Integrating machine learning models for automatic classification and prediction of food quality, improving the accuracy and scalability of the system.
        Enhancing real-time processing for large image datasets and live video streams.

Technical Stack:

    Programming Languages: Python
    Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Tkinter, PyTorch, Pillow, Scikit-Image
    Machine Learning Frameworks: YOLO (for real-time object detection), PyTorch (for model deployment)
    GUI Framework: Tkinter (for creating the user interface)

## Features
Real-Time Fruit Detection:

    Uses YOLOv5 for object detection to identify and classify fruits in images.
    Detects and classifies fruits as fresh or spoiled based on their color, texture, and brightness.

Biscuit Crack Detection:

    Utilizes image processing techniques like Canny edge detection to identify cracks in biscuits.
    Categorizes biscuits as cracked or not cracked based on edge analysis.

Quality Classification for Fruits:

    Analyzes fruits using color, texture, and brightness features to determine if they are fresh or spoiled.
    Uses Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for texture analysis and HSV for color analysis to detect spoilage.

User Interface:

    Provides a simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter for users to upload images and view results.
    Displays the image along with real-time analysis of the food's quality (e.g., number of fresh/spoiled fruits or cracked biscuits).

Image Preprocessing:

    Enhances image quality through contrast adjustment and brightness normalization.
    Converts images to HSV color space and applies histogram equalization for better visibility and analysis.

Machine Learning and Deep Learning Integration:

    Uses YOLOv5 (pre-trained deep learning model) for detecting fruits in images.
    Combines image features with machine learning techniques to classify food quality.

Smoothing of Predictions:

    Implements a smoothing mechanism using a history of predictions (last 5 results) to make the final classification more stable.

Real-Time Analysis and Feedback:

    Provides real-time feedback on the quality of fruits and biscuits based on the uploaded images.
    Instantaneous quality assessment (fresh/spoiled, cracked/not cracked) once the image is processed.

Support for Multiple Fruits:

    Detects and classifies multiple fruits in a single image, counting how many are fresh and how many are spoiled.

Data Preprocessing for Consistency:

    Handles variations in image quality, lighting, and background by normalizing and enhancing the images before analysis.

## Results and Impact
Accurate Quality Detection:

    The system can successfully analyze the quality of fruits and vegetables by detecting spoilage based on visual features like texture, color, and contrast.
    Fresh and spoiled items are identified with a higher accuracy after refining the detection algorithm.

Grading System:

    The system assigns quality grades (A, B, C, D) to batches of fruits and vegetables based on the spoilage ratio, providing clear and actionable insights.

Item Counting:

    The program detects and counts the number of fresh and spoiled items when multiple objects are present in the uploaded image.

GUI Functionality:

    A user-friendly interface has been developed, enabling users to upload images and receive detailed quality analysis results in real-time.

Improved Spoilage Detection:

    Enhanced algorithms have resolved previous inaccuracies, such as fresh items being classified as spoiled (e.g., fresh bananas now correctly identified as fresh).
